				<li>
					<strong>

					Carries no personal data; send it as it is.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						<code>DamageMeter.bin</code> &mdash; what the server actually paid out.
					</strong>{' '}
					Forever blocks addons from reading damage, so the client&apos;s own meter is the only measurement there will be. Twelve abilities have been
					confirmed this way so far, out of 996. It does carry character names, so it gets scrubbed in your browser first.{' '}
					<strong>Getting one out is fiddly:</strong> open the meter, fight things, log out to character select, then copy the file before logging
					back in &mdash; logging in deletes it.

		<Panel summary="Where the numbers come from">
			<p className="m-0">
				Since the beta client was datamined on 17 September the numbers come from the client&apos;s own data tables rather than BlizzCon tooltips: build{' '}
				<code>1.60.1.69913</code> on wago.tools, read against Classic Era and diffed spell by spell. Talent values come from the client&apos;s rank
				curves, coefficients from <code>SpellEffect.EffectBonusCoefficient</code>, and each rank&apos;s damage is scaled to level 60 by the
				client&apos;s own per-level points.
			</p>
			<p className="m-0">Most of it is settled from data, a little of it has been seen happen, and it is worth being plain about which is which:</p>
			<ul className="m-0 flex flex-col gap-2 pl-5">
				<li>
					<strong>The client&apos;s tables, diffed against Classic Era.</strong> 656 abilities carry the client&apos;s numbers and 297 are confirmed
					unchanged from Classic.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Hotfixes, which the static data does not carry.</strong> The live client&apos;s own cache is read instead. Today it holds 11,800
					changed rows, all item data, with a 4 byte stub for spells.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Wording, not just values.</strong> A rank curve says what a talent&apos;s numbers are, not what they apply to, which is how Improved
					Seals passed a value check while scaling half of what it should. 231 talents read differently in Forever.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Twelve abilities have now been watched happen on a running server</strong> &mdash; through the client&apos;s own damage meter, on
					the beta &mdash; and every one landed where the client&apos;s tables said it would. Twelve out of 996, so the honest reading is that the
					method works, not that the sim is verified. The other 984 are internally consistent and externally unconfirmed.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p className="m-0">
				<a href={`${SITE_BASE}evidence/`}>Every ability, and what is known about its numbers</a> &mdash; the whole list, filterable, with the reason
				attached to each row.
			</p>
		</Panel>
		<Panel summary="What it still cannot do">
			<p className="m-0">Every one of these can move a number, and some can move it a long way:</p>
			<ul className="m-0 flex flex-col gap-2 pl-5">
				<li>
					43 abilities still carry a number the client does not settle &mdash; 25 of them hunter. Each is named on the{' '}
					<a href={`${SITE_BASE}evidence/`}>evidence page</a>, in the spell manifest, and in the{' '}
					<a href={`${SITE_REPO_URL}/blob/master/docs/forever_beta_checklist.md`} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
						beta re-verification checklist
					</a>
					.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Downranking is unresolved, and it is the big one.</strong> The client carries the full coefficient on low ranks where Classic Era
					carried a reduced one. Read as written, a rank 4 Lightning Bolt does most of a rank 10 for a quarter of the mana. Whether Forever removed
					the penalty changes every caster here.
				</li>
				<li>
					The client stores what an ability does, not how the server runs it. Proc chances often read as unset, and rules like whether melee-table
					Holy damage partially resists are in no table.
				</li>
				<li>
					No healing sim runs, tank specs are measured on damage alone, and rotations are hand-written priority lists that nothing has re-tuned around
					the cooldowns Forever changed.
