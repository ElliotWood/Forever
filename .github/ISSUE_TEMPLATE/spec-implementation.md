## Description

Everything needed to implement **<Spec> <Class>** for Forever: Go backend logic for abilities, talents,
gear interactions and simulation settings, and the frontend components for configuring the spec and
displaying its output. One checkbox per talent and per ability family.

Datamined from client build `<build>` (`wow_classic_beta`), trait tree `<id>`: **N ability families**
and **N talents** after filtering. Counts and IDs are a starting point to verify against the client,
not gospel.

<!--
Generate the lists below rather than typing them. See
.github/skills/wowsims-spec-implementation/SKILL.md - it names the extract, the filters and the traps.
Say which content you excluded and why, so a re-run that produces different counts is explainable.
-->

Season of Discovery content is excluded. <List what the build still carries that is not live here.>

## Talents

### <Tab> (N)

- [ ] **<Talent>** — N ranks, tier N — <what it does>

## Abilities

### <Tree> (N)

- [ ] <Ability> (`<rootSpellId>`) — N ranks, N rage, Ns CD

- [ ] Add configuration options to simulation settings (optional)
- [ ] Develop and refine the APL
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests

## Frontend Tasks

- [ ] Update the configuration UI
- [ ] Display spec-specific simulation output, for new resources (optional)
